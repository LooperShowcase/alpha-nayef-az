    Ronnie Dean Coleman (born May 13, 1964) is an American retired
    professional bodybuilder. The winner of the Mr. Olympia title for eight
    consecutive years, he is widely regarded as either 'the greatest' or one
    of the two greatest bodybuilders of all time along-with Arnold
    Schwarzenegger[4][5][6] and as the most dominant bodybuilding physique
    ever to grace the stage.[7] Winner of 26 IFBB professional titles, he is
    also renowned for his combination of size and conditioning,[8] dominant
    body-parts[9][10] and extremely heavy workouts,[11] making him the
    strongest bodybuilder and Mr. Olympia of all time. Ronnie Dean Coleman
    was born in Monroe, Louisiana, on May 13, 1964.[2] He graduated cum
    laude from Grambling State University in 1984 with a BSc in
    accounting.[14] While there, he played football as a middle linebacker
    with the GSU Tigers under coach Eddie Robinson. After graduation, he
    failed to find work as an accountant and instead went to work at
    Domino's Pizza, where he would eat the complimentary pizza every day due
    to being so poor that he could barely afford to eat outside of work.[15]
    He then became a police officer in Arlington, Texas, serving as an
    officer from 1989 to 2000 and a reserve officer until 2003
