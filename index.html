        Ronnie Dean Coleman (born May 13, 1964) is an American retired
        professional bodybuilder. The winner of the Mr. Olympia title for eight
        consecutive years, he is widely regarded as either 'the greatest' or one
        of the two greatest bodybuilders of all time along-with Arnold
        Schwarzenegger[4][5][6] and as the most dominant bodybuilding physique
        ever to grace the stage.[7] Winner of 26 IFBB professional titles, he is
        also renowned for his combination of size and conditioning,[8] dominant
        body-parts[9][10] and extremely heavy workouts,[11] making him the
        strongest bodybuilder and Mr. Olympia of all time. Ronnie Dean Coleman
        was born in Monroe, Louisiana, on May 13, 1964.[2] He graduated cum
        laude from Grambling State University in 1984 with a BSc in
        accounting.[14] While there, he played football as a middle linebacker
        with the GSU Tigers under coach Eddie Robinson. After graduation, he
        failed to find work as an accountant and instead went to work at
        Domino's Pizza, where he would eat the complimentary pizza every day due
        to being so poor that he could barely afford to eat outside of work.[15]
        He then became a police officer in Arlington, Texas, serving as an
        officer from 1989 to 2000 and a reserve officer until 2003
